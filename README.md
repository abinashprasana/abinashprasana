I’m an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at Dublin Business School, working mainly with Python, data analysis, and machine learning.

I enjoy building practical projects using real datasets, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model building. Most of my work is hands-on and learning-driven, where I try to understand how things work rather than just using libraries as black boxes.

Lately, I’ve been exploring NLP and getting started with Large Language Models (LLMs), including small local experiments and retrieval-based approaches. I’m interested in how machine learning models are built, evaluated, and used in real-world applications.

This GitHub is mainly a collection of my learning projects, experiments, and practice work as I continue improving my skills in AI and data-focused development.

### 🔭 Currently working on
- Building small projects using real data to understand problems and find solutions
- Working on machine learning projects related to healthcare, text data, and predictions, etc
- Creating simple tools where users can upload data or documents and get useful outputs
- Experimenting with basic AI features such as question answering from documents
- Improving how I structure projects and explain my work clearly through code and README files

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Working with real data to clean it, understand it, and find useful patterns
- Building machine learning models and learning how to check if they work well
- Working with text data such as news articles and documents
- Learning core Artificial Intelligence concepts as part of my MSc course
- Understanding how Large Language Models (chat-style AI systems) work at a basic level
- Trying small experiments with local AI models and document-based question answering
- Writing cleaner Python code and organizing projects better

⚡ I prefer working on a few meaningful projects rather than many small ones.
