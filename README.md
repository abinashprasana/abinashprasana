I’m an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at Dublin Business School, mainly working with Python, data analysis, and ML.

I enjoy building practical projects using real datasets, focusing on data cleaning, understanding patterns in data, and building simple ML models. Most of my work is hands-on and learning-driven, where I try to understand how things work rather than just using tools blindly.

Recently, I’ve been exploring natural language processing and getting started with Large Language Models (LLMs) through small local experiments and document-based question answering.

This GitHub is a collection of my learning projects and experiments as I continue developing my skills in AI and data-focused development.

### 🔭 Currently working on
- Building small projects using real-world data to understand problems and create simple solutions
- Working on machine learning projects related to healthcare data, text data, and basic predictions, etc
- Creating simple tools where users can upload data or documents and get useful results
- Exploring basic AI use cases such as answering questions from documents
- Improving how I structure projects and explain my work clearly through clean code and README files

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Working with real data to clean it, understand it, and find useful patterns
- Building machine learning models and learning how to evaluate their performance
- Working with text data such as news articles and documents
- Learning core Artificial Intelligence concepts as part of my MSc course
- Understanding how Large Language Models (chat-style AI systems) work at a basic level
- Running small experiments with local AI models and document-based question answering
- Writing cleaner Python code and organizing projects in a better way

⚡ I prefer working on a few meaningful projects rather than many small ones.
