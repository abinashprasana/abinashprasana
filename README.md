## Hi there 👋

I’m Abinash Prasana Selavanathan, an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at Dublin Business School.  
I work mainly with Python, data analysis, and machine learning, and I enjoy building practical projects using real data.

Before moving to Ireland, I worked at Deloitte as an Associate Analyst, supporting healthcare IT systems. That experience helped me understand how real systems work and how to solve problems in structured environments.
