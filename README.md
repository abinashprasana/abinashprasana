I’m an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at Dublin Business School, working mainly with Python, data analysis, and machine learning.  
I enjoy building practical projects that solve real problems using real data.

Before moving to Ireland, I worked at Deloitte as an Associate Analyst, supporting healthcare IT systems. That experience helped me understand how real systems operate and how to solve problems in structured, production environments.
