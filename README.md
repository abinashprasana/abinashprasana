I’m an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at Dublin Business School, working mainly with Python, data analysis, and machine learning.  
I like building practical projects that solve real problems using real data.

Before moving to Ireland, I worked at Deloitte as an Associate Analyst, supporting healthcare IT systems. That experience gave me hands-on exposure to real production environments, structured workflows, and problem solving under constraints.
